# UFC_Section4_Food_Tracker
The Ultimate Flask Course by Anthony Herbert.

This section involves utilizing the various concepts that have been taught so far to build a food tracking app.
There isn't necessarily direct topics that'll be taught but whenever a new concept comes up during the building of the app, thorough notes will be taken in the accompanying Section4_Notes.txt file.

The Food Tracker app itself is an app whereby a user can log the consumed food for a given day alongside the protein, carbohydrates, fats and calories for each food item as well as a total summary of these values for the day.
We are incorporating a relational database structure in this app using mutliple linked tables alongside templates for the actual frontend of the app.

We'll additionally be looking through a tutorial on how to deployto an Amazon Lightsail server for app deployment.
