# Section 4: Food Tracker App

## 28) Demo

This lesson gives a brief overview of what the app we're building in this section.
It's a food tracker that visualizes a list of dates, and it shows the calories and macros for each day and have the functionality to add food for a day as well as view all the foods eaten on a given day.
It also saves previously added foods for quick access for adding again later on.

## 29) The Starting HTML Files:

This section covers downloading the starting html files for this particular web app, alongside this is also a deeper look into the functionalities and what we're starting out with functionality wise on the html files.

## 30) Adding Templates

We're starting out with some basic flask setup.
Then we'll get 3 routes initialized to match up with the 3 html file pages that'll be on the app.
Once the routes are set up and loading successfully, we'll add in the css files for styling.
To add the css files, we create the static folder in our working directory and add them to it.
We'll also be updating the templates to look for the CSS file:
    "<link href="{{ url_for('static', filename='bootstrap.min.css') }} rel="styleshoot">"
    "<link href="{{ url_for('static', filename='theme.css') }}>"
With this we'll save and reload the app to check that the styling is coming through on all 3 html files.
